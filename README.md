# That Girl - Health & Wellness App

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction
That Girl is an iOS app that promotes women prioritizing their health and wellness in a social way. By creating your group of friends, enhanced accountability is reached in the pursuit of each other's goals. Daily, users get to track the way they've put their wellness first by checking off items like "30 minute exercise" and "night time skincare". By incorporating a feed that allows for text and image upload, users get to keep up with their friends accomplishments and thoughts as the mutual goal of becoming "that goal" is being reached.
